  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 thin steak cuts (such as sirloin or round steak)</li>
    <li>2 cups breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped (optional)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>Lemon wedges for serving</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Prepare the Steaks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Pound the steaks with a meat mallet to tenderize and thin
          them out if they are not already thin.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Set Up the Breading Station:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Place the flour in a shallow dish.</li>
        <li>In another shallow dish, beat the eggs and mix in the milk, minced garlic, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a third shallow dish, combine the breadcrumbs, paprika, and chopped parsley if using.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bread the Steaks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Dredge each steak in the flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
        <li>Dip the floured steak into the egg mixture, coating it thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Finally, coat the steak with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing
          gently to ensure the breadcrumbs adhere well.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fry the Steaks:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high
          heat. Once the oil is hot (you can test it by dropping a small piece of
          bread into the oil – it should sizzle and turn golden quickly), carefully
          place the breaded steaks into the skillet.</li>
        <li>Fry the steaks for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until they are golden
          brown and crispy. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent burning.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Drain and Serve:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove the fried steaks from the skillet and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any
          excess oil. Serve the milanesa hot with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the top.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
